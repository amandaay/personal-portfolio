                  <p>
                    I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer
                    Science. I received my Doctorate degree in Pharmacy and
                    completed clinical rotations, and I worked as a pharmacist
                    previously. I have a strong desire to see advancements in
                    the tools that professionals use. I believe that medicine
                    and technology can work interdependently, and I am eager to
                    build the tools to engage in the cross intersections between
                    healthcare and tech. My goal is to find an opportunity in
                    this field to make a difference by engineering the tools we
                    use. I gained experience via building projects as displayed
                    on my github and worked for a non-profit organization. In
                    this past summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Amazon,
                    where I have honed in skills to grow as a software engineer.
                    I built projects collaboratively and independently. As I am
                    highly adaptable, I am open to any opportunities in tech
                    that involves with or without healthcare to further develop
                    my skills in tech.
